# HongFire Project!

This is a community hentai game project that aims to make a game that fills the blanks where other companies/indie eroge makers leave behind. By that, we mean that this project is open source, so anyone is free to contribute. Our project builds and runs on Windows and OS X platforms.

## Feature List

-  1st Person Gameplay (Overworld, etc) using Physics; 3rd Person H-Scenes.
-  PDA that records vital information collected through story mode
-  Story Mode (with options like Survival, FastHarem, etc) / Endless Sex (Free Mode) / Minigame Mode (Moe Zombies, etc)
-  Runs on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X (PowerPC/Intel Universal Binary)
-  Open Source (source tarballs will be available after each "major" milestone)
-  Boobies that aren't lumps of wet sand
-  More ideas in the "random idea bucket" than you can poke a stick at!

We're a indie game team and we've all helping each other here. Unity3D is the easiest engine (okay, maybe a little annoying at times) that we've played with - ask the other developers. Sure, it may not be so powerful like other engines, but we're all "at home" with the engine. And sometimes, GUI-based tools are better than writing lines of code in a console or text editor! Who knows, we might be able to get the limelight someday. If you want to contribute something, even if it's feedback, project support, ideas, models, sounds, etc... It's all welcome, and we'll try to use it in whatever way we can.

### Inspiration

Illusion's eroge games fueled the urge to want to get out and make a game - not just sit in front of the PC, be part of a team that wants to show that indie developers can make a good eroge game!

Only thing with this project is that since it's a community effort, we'd have to try to keep costs down to a minimum. That means someone would have to devote time if they know Blender/Maya/3D Studio Max for modelling the characters, someone does the model texturing, etc. Someone will have to do the animation for the sex positions, etc.

We've seen the likes of Daminz's 3D Realtime Pussy, so I thought "Why not make a cross-platform Hentai game?" I'm willing to do something, but without community support, it will most likely not take off from the ground. What are your thoughts? Should we team up and make a game, exclusive to HongFire and make Illusion jizz their pants at the same time?

Suggestions/ideas are more than welcome. 

### Huh?

In a nutshell, this project is a community ecchi game project that offers what the big name ecchi companies offer without the price tag. It's also cross-platform, we can compile builds for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows (Native 32Bit & 64Bit). Maybe someday, even Linux (!) support...

## Project Releases

-  Win32 refers to Windows 32Bit. Win64 refers to Windows 64Bit. Etc etc.
-  Most releases are available in my mirror: [Click here](http://cdn.coburndomain.net/EcchiProject/).

_Important Note: Please do not upload the game demos to any other file hosting websites. It produces a headache on what version is the latest, etc. If you wish to upload it somewhere for your own forum/etc, please talk to me first._

Old releases are available on the mirror.

## FAQ

### Where do I sign in?

Do it in the [main thread](http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/369348). In your post include those points:

-  Why do you want to help and how long do you expect to be in this project?
-  What is your experience with programming, Unity and game development?
-  What do you want to do? (inteface, models, maps etc.)
-  If you can, post something you made or helped in making. 

### Why Unity Engine instead of xyz?
Here is a list of reasons why unity is better than other engines:

-  Unity is very flexible, it can use a lot of different filetypes and do a lot of different things.
-  It is made to be universal, engines like UDK3 or source are focused on blowing stuff up.
-  It is fully free and without any content constrains.
-  If you are new to game development Unity is a very good place to start.
-  Multiplatform support! You can compile for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, web-browsers and god knows what else.
-   Developers like it.


Here is a list of reasons why we can't use that engine you talk about:

-  Even if engine is free for non-commercial applications there is a good chance there are sexual content restrictions. Last thing we need is a cease-and-desist letter in final development stages.
-  Most of those high-tech engines are optimized for a specific type of game. Ever wondered why all source games have similar menus and interface?
-  Most of them are harder to develop on and project would take much longer to produce next versions.


### If this project going to be fully open source?
Yes, source tarballs will be available after each "major" milestone.

### When the game is out in a playable form will I be able to contribute to the code?
Yes. This is a future talk, probably you will have to create a new code branch with your modifications and post info about your work in a dev thread. If it's good it will be merged into the main branch. Don't blame me if I'm completely wrong.

### Will it be easy to mod this game?
Yes! Source will be available so even extreme changes to the game can be done easily. If your mod is good it might get merged into the project too! (at your permission of course)

### I found this awesome tech demo, is this going to be included?
Most likely no. Tech demos like nVidia's hair tessellation demo require immense amounts of power to run at barely fluid fps levels. One of the goals of this project is to run decently on most of Hongfire population's computers. Obviously quality levels will be adjustable so don't worry, support for slow hardware won't make the game ugly.

### But models/maps/whatever in this game on that are looking beautiful!
It's not engine that makes them look good, it's people who made those models! You'd be surprised what a few professional full-time developers could do in Unity.

### Blender sucks.
Not really a question, Blender is a very good (free) application but requires you to learn the interface first. Learning curve is very steep so it is NOT recommended for beginners! Some people hate it, some people love it - get over it.
