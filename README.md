# HongFire Project!

This is a community hentai game project that aims to make a game that fills the blanks where other companies/indie eroge makers leave behind. By that, we mean that this project is open source, so anyone is free to contribute. Our project builds and runs on Windows and OS X platforms.

## Feature List

-  1st Person Gameplay (Overworld, etc) using Physics; 3rd Person H-Scenes.
-  PDA that records vital information collected through story mode
-  Story Mode (with options like Survival, FastHarem, etc) / Endless Sex (Free Mode) / Minigame Mode (Moe Zombies, etc)
-  Runs on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X (PowerPC/Intel Universal Binary)
-  Open Source (source tarballs will be available after each "major" milestone)
-  Boobies that aren't lumps of wet sand
-  More ideas in the "random idea bucket" than you can poke a stick at!

We're a indie game team and we've all helping each other here. Unity3D is the easiest engine (okay, maybe a little annoying at times) that we've played with - ask the other developers. Sure, it may not be so powerful like other engines, but we're all "at home" with the engine. And sometimes, GUI-based tools are better than writing lines of code in a console or text editor! Who knows, we might be able to get the limelight someday. If you want to contribute something, even if it's feedback, project support, ideas, models, sounds, etc... It's all welcome, and we'll try to use it in whatever way we can.

### Huh?

In a nutshell, this project is a community ecchi game project that offers what the big name ecchi companies offer without the price tag. It's also cross-platform, we can compile builds for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows (Native 32Bit & 64Bit). Maybe someday, even Linux (!) support...

## Developers

## Project Releases

-  Win32 refers to Windows 32Bit. Win64 refers to Windows 64Bit. Etc etc.
-  Most releases are available in my mirror: [Click here](http://cdn.coburndomain.net/EcchiProject/).

_Important Note: Please do not upload the game demos to any other file hosting websites. It produces a headache on what version is the latest, etc. If you wish to upload it somewhere for your own forum/etc, please talk to me first._

Old releases are available on the mirror.

## Unity3D Background info

Unity 3D, available at http://unity3d.com. The indie version is the best game studio this side of one million bucks.

Unity 3D uses UnityScript (aka Unity version of JavaScript) and C# Mono Scripts for it's engine, and supports various platforms. Currently, the Indie version of the engine exports games to Windows and Mac. Using Unity is a piece of cake, it's way better than learning how to code from stratch. You point and click, assign objects to scripts, drag scripts onto objects, etc.

### Why we're not using CryEngine/Unreal Engine

This has been asked many times before, and I hate having to repeat myself. The project developers feel more at home with Unity. While other engines are kickass and look super-duper, **they don't fit the purpose of the game's aim**. And plus, this project is already in development - we're not going to quit and port it over to something the devs don't understand. Once the project code is released, then be our guest and port it over to whatever engine that makes you drool. Good luck with that...

Thank you for your attention.

## Inspiration

Illusion's eroge games fueled the urge to want to get out and make a game - not just sit in front of the PC, be part of a team that wants to show that indie developers can make a good eroge game!

Only thing with this project is that since it's a community effort, we'd have to try to keep costs down to a minimum. That means someone would have to devote time if they know Blender/Maya/3D Studio Max for modelling the characters, someone does the model texturing, etc. Someone will have to do the animation for the sex positions, etc.

We've seen the likes of Daminz's 3D Realtime Pussy, so I thought "Why not make a cross-platform Hentai game?" I'm willing to do something, but without community support, it will most likely not take off from the ground. What are your thoughts? Should we team up and make a game, exclusive to HongFire and make Illusion jizz their pants at the same time?


Suggestions/ideas are more than welcome.
