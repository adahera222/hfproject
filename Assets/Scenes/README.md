/Assets/Scenes

This is the "Scenes" folder is where we store all our zone files, for example, title screen, advertisements, etc.

It contains the following folders:

-  **Crap** - Uh... it says what it is on the tin.
-  **PreTitle** - This is for any scenes that appear before the title screen. For example, sponsors, ads (Pop cherries like a boss with ATI), 18+ Warning, etc.
-  **PostTitle** - Scenes that just happen after the user starts up the game. For example, opening cutscene, example H session, etc.
-  **Zone[One,Two,Three...]** - Useful scene storage we're seperating stuff around.
