/Assets/Resources

The "Resources" folder is basically a folder to separate the files from Unity's stock ones. There's folders in here that are as follows:

-  **Audio** - Music and sound effects.
-  **Models** - Contains subfolders with model dumps.
-  **Scripts** - Custom scripts.
-  **Textures** - Standalone textures not used for characters.
-  **Other** - Misc content.
